Building and Installing the IBM® SPSS® Statistics-R Package
March, 2021


Introduction
------------
This directory is used to build and install the IBM SPSS Statistics-R package for the following platforms:
    - Windows
    - UNIX (Linux64, MacOS, ZLinux64, PLinux64)

Prerequisites
-------------
    Rtools has to be installed (For Windows platform. You can download it from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
    R 4.0.* has to be installed (For Windows, Linux64, MacOS, ZLinux64 and PLinux64 platforms)

Environment variables
---------------------
The following environment variables must be set prior to building the IBM SPSS Statistics-R package:
    Windows:
        R_HOME - must be defined as the location of your R installation
        RTOOLS - must be defined as the location where Rtools is installed
    Linux64:
        R_HOME - must be defined as the location of your R installation
        SPSS_HOME - must be defined as the location of your IBM SPSS Statistics installation
        Add <SPSS_HOME>/lib and <R_HOME>/lib/R/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
        Add <R_HOME>/bin to PATH.
    MacOS:
        R_HOME - must be defined as the location of your R installation
        SPSS_HOME - must be defined as the location of your IBM SPSS Statistics installation
        Add <SPSS_HOME>/lib and <R_HOME>/lib to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    ZLinux64:
        R_HOME - must be defined as the location of your R installation
        SPSS_HOME - must be defined as the location of your IBM SPSS Statistics installation
        Add <SPSS_HOME>/lib and <R_HOME>/lib/R/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
        Add <R_HOME>/bin to PATH.
    PLinux64:
        R_HOME - must be defined as the location of your R installation
        SPSS_HOME - must be defined as the location of your IBM SPSS Statistics installation
        Add <SPSS_HOME>/lib and <R_HOME>/lib/R/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
        Add <R_HOME>/bin to PATH.



Building and installing the IBM SPSS Statistics-R package using buildpkg.bat on Windows
----------------------------------------------------------
Usage Synopsis:
Creating the IBM SPSS Statistics-R source package and installing it:
  If you need the 64-bit package on Win64, use: buildpkg.bat

Building and installing the IBM SPSS Statistics-R package using buildpkgUnix.sh on UNIX platforms
----------------------------------------------------------
Usage Synopsis:
Creating the IBM SPSS Statistics-R source package and installing it:
  ./buildpkgUnix.sh
  
Notes
-----
After the build succeeds, spssxd_path needs to be changed in the file spssxdcfg.ini in order to run the package successfully.
For windows this file should be located at R_HOME/library/spssstatistics/spssxdcfg.ini,
For UNIX it should be at R_HOME/lib/R/library/spssstatistics/spssxdcfg.ini

A corresponding change needs to be made to spssdxcfg.ini in order to use the Plug-in functionality with IBM® SPSS® Statistics.
For windows this file should be located at $SPSS_HOME/spssdxcfg.ini,
For UNIX it should be at $SPSS_HOME/bin/spssdxcfg.ini
