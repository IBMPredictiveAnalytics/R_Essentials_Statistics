Perl 5. Artistic License:
?Perl 5.10.1
The Program includes some or all of the following that IBM obtained under the
Artistic License (source code available via the indicated URL):"
http://dev.perl.org/licenses/artistic.html
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.
Definitions:
"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
created through textual modification.
"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
copyrights for the package.
"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
this Package.
"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the
Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
as a market that must bear the fee.)
"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
under the same conditions they received it.
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:
a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
to get the Standard Version.
b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
the Package with your modifications.
c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
product of your own. You may embed this Package's interpreter within
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
interpreter is so embedded.
6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.
7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.
8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be
construed as a distribution of this Package.
9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Perl 5. Artistic License:
?Perl 5.10.1
The Program includes some or all of the following that IBM obtained under the
Artistic License (source code available via the indicated URL):"
http://dev.perl.org/licenses/artistic.html
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.
Definitions:
"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
created through textual modification.
"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
copyrights for the package.
"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
this Package.
"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the
Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
as a market that must bear the fee.)
"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
under the same conditions they received it.
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:
a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
to get the Standard Version.
b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
the Package with your modifications.
c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
product of your own. You may embed this Package's interpreter within
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
interpreter is so embedded.
6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.
7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.
8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be
construed as a distribution of this Package.
9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

ZLIB CODE. The Program includes the following zlib software:
?zlib 1.2.3
IBM obtained the right to use the software under the following license from
zlib:
zlib 1.2.3 is a general purpose data compression library. All the code is
thread safe. The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs
(Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate format)
and rfc1952.txt (gzip format). These documents are also available in other
formats from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/zlib/zdoc-index.html
All functions of the compression library are documented in the file zlib.h
(volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact zlib@gzip.org). A usage example
of the library is given in the file example.c which also tests that the library
is working correctly. Another example is given in the file minigzip.c. The
compression library itself is composed of all source files except example.c and
minigzip.c.
To compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions given at
the top of Makefile. In short "make test; make install" should work for most
machines. For Unix: "./configure; make test; make install". For MSDOS, use one
of the special makefiles such as Makefile.msc. For VMS, use make_vms.com.
Questions about zlib should be sent to <zlib@gzip.org>, or to Gilles Vollant
<info@winimage.com> for the Windows DLL version. The zlib home page is
http://www.zlib.org or http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ Before reporting a problem,
please check this site to verify that you have the latest version of zlib;
otherwise get the latest version and check whether the problem still exists or
not.
PLEASE read the zlib FAQ http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_faq.html before asking
for help.
Mark Nelson <markn@ieee.org> wrote an article about zlib for the Jan. 1997 issue
of Dr. Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available in
http://dogma.net/markn/articles/zlibtool/zlibtool.htm
The changes made in version 1.2.3 are documented in the file ChangeLog.
Unsupported third party contributions are provided in directory "contrib".
A Java implementation of zlib is available in the Java Development Kit
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/zip/package-summary.html See
the zlib home page http://www.zlib.org for details.
A Perl interface to zlib written by Paul Marquess <pmqs@cpan.org> is in the CPAN
(Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites http://www.cpan.org/modules/bymodule/
Compress/
A Python interface to zlib written by A.M. Kuchling <amk@amk.ca> is available in
Python 1.5 and later versions, see http://www.python.org/doc/lib/modulezlib.
html
A zlib binding for TCL written by Andreas Kupries <a.kupries@westend.com> is
availlable at http://www.oche.de/~akupries/soft/trf/trf_zip.html
An experimental package to read and write files in .zip format, written on top
of zlib by Gilles Vollant <info@winimage.com>, is available in the
contrib/minizip directory of zlib.
Notes for some targets:
- For Windows DLL versions, please see win32/DLL_FAQ.txt
- For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization. With -
O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with the -n32
compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.
- zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1 it works
when compiled with cc.
- On Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the cc option -std1 is
necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. This is done by configure.
- zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It works with
other compilers. Use "make test" to check your compiler.
- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS, BEOS and by some Mac compilers.
- For PalmOs, see http://palmzlib.sourceforge.net/
- When building a shared, i.e. dynamic library on Mac OS X, the library must be
installed before testing (do "make install" before "make test"), since the
library location is specified in the library.
Acknowledgments:
The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz. The deflate and zlib
specifications were written by L. Peter Deutsch. Thanks to all the people who
reported problems and suggested various improvements in zlib; they are too
numerous to cite here.

Introduction
---------------------
MiniZip 1.1 is built from MiniZip 1.0 by Gilles Vollant
( http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html )
When adding ZIP64 support into minizip it would result into risk of breaking
compatibility with minizip 1.0.
All possible work was done for compatibility.
Background
---------------------
When adding ZIP64 support Mathias Svensson found that Even Rouault have added
ZIP64
support for unzip.c into minizip for a open source project called gdal
( http://www.gdal.org/ )
That was used as a starting point. And after that ZIP64 support was added to
zip.c
some refactoring and code cleanup was also done.
Changed from MiniZip 1.0 to MiniZip 1.1
---------------------------------------
* Added ZIP64 support for unzip ( by Even Rouault )
* Added ZIP64 support for zip ( by Mathias Svensson )
* Reverted some changed that Even Rouault did.
* Bunch of patches received from Gulles Vollant that he received for MiniZip
from various users.
* Added unzip patch for BZIP Compression method (patch create by Daniel Borca)
* Added BZIP Compress method for zip
* Did some refactoring and code cleanup
